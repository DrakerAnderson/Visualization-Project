# Visualization-Project

Data Visualization Project

The data we propose to visualize for this project is to use the NFL website to query data from the last 50 years to analyze the impact of major rule changes on kick returns, unnecessary roughness, and special teams have on the season of the NFL teams. We predict that 

We will use Python to scrape the NFL website to create CSV files to store all of our data and SQL to house our data,
We will use an altervative library called NFL Data Scraper to import data

Questions & Tasks
The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

How does the frequency of kick returns vary over time do to rules changed in 1974, 2011?
Is there any correlation between successful returns and these rule changes?
Does the inclusion of unnecessary roughness affect the longevity of a quarterbacks career?
How does the 1974 rule changing location of the goal post affect succesful fg attempts?
What is the impact of special teams on win loss records?

Visualizations planning on creating
Chart showing year of special teams rule changes and successful kick returns
Map of cities that have had NFL teams with layers of team stats by season
Planned HTML site using java to direct users to answer our questions
